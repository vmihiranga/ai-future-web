## ‚ú® Features

`ai-future-web` is designed to be a robust and interactive platform, offering a glimpse into the future of AI integration with web applications.

*   üöÄ **High-Performance Backend:** Built with Express.js to provide a fast and scalable server for AI-driven content.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Secure API Endpoints:** Implements `express-rate-limit` to protect against abuse and ensure stable service delivery.
*   üåê **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Configured with `cors` for seamless integration with various frontend clients and external services.
*   üí° **Dynamic Content Fetching:** Utilizes `node-fetch` for robust server-side data fetching, enabling integration with external AI APIs and services.
*   üì± **Responsive User Interface:** Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an engaging and accessible experience across all devices.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get `ai-future-web` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vmihiranga/ai-future-web.git
    cd ai-future-web
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration (Optional but Recommended):**
    If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys, port numbers), create a `.env` file in the root directory.

    ```dotenv
    # Example .env content
    PORT=3000
    API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE=your_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Start the Server:**
    Once dependencies are installed and configuration is set, you can start the server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once the server is running, you can access the web application through your browser or interact with its API endpoints.

### Accessing the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the `ai-future-web` interface, which might present various AI-powered features or information.

### Interacting with the API (Example)

If the project exposes API endpoints, you can test them using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl`.

**Example: Fetching AI-generated content**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ai-content
```

**Example: Sending data for AI processing**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Explain the concept of neural networks."}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/process-text
```

Refer to the `server.js` file and any accompanying API documentation for specific endpoint details.
